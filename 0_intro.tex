\part{Towards Highly Miniaturized LED Power Systems }
\label{ch:twrd_HMLED}

\chapter{The new coming LED based lighting industry}
This section will make a little dissertation about what is the way to go:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cost driven driver production the cheapest the better
  \item Miniaturization + smart driver integration 
\end{enumerate}

this section should gasp the current efforts done in order to introduce the LED light to the market. And say that the present way is retrofitting.

The section should close facing the dilemma that once the retrofitting is done where it will be the new market cases, and point that highly integrated drivers
can be one of the possible scenarios where integration and connectivity are part of a single solution.
