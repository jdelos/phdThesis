An experimental converter was built with the goal to validate the performances of a H-SCC as a LED driver. The LED driver, described in the block diagram of Figure~\ref{fig:bd_emerge_drv}, was built using discrete components following the specifications of Table~\ref{tab:dsg_param_drv}.

The driver was designed to be compliment the 24Vdc e-Merge Alliance standard used in track lighting systems, and featured two outputs. The main output supplies a \emph{LUXENON Altion} LED with a maximum current of 1A with a forward voltage around 12V, thus providing 12W at full load. The secondary output is designed for low-voltage and low-power to supply other auxiliary electronic circuits. The minimum efficiency was fixed to be higher than 85\%, and the switching frequency to be 2.77MHz, taking advantage of a 3dB higher tolerance of the conduced EMI standard X. 

\section{Design procedure}
The LED driver is composed by two main subsystems, the power train and the close-controller. Therefore the design process is accordingly  divided in three main parts: Power train design, small-signal analysis and close-loop controller design.
