title={A stackable switched-capacitor DC/DC converter IC for LED drivers with 90% efficiency},
year={2013},
month={Sept},
pages={1-4},
abstract={A stackable switched-capacitor (SC) converter IC for a hybrid-SC-resonant LED driver using off-chip ceramic capacitors is presented in this paper. The IC can be configured to handle a range of input voltages through chip-stacking in the voltage domain. The tested driver delivers 17.6W at 470mA to the LED load with 90% peak efficiency from a rectified 120VAC line (170VDC) and maintains >85% efficiency over a rectified voltage range from 16VDC to 180VDC.},
