\section{Introduction}

\section{Single Output Converters}
Switched Capacitor Converters (SCCs) are considered to be a two-port converter with single input and a single output as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:two_port}. The input port is connected to a voltage source and the output port feeds the load. The SCC provides between input, $v_i$, and output, $v_o$, a voltage conversion, $m$,  that  steps up, steps down or/and inverts the polarity of the input voltage. Up to present all the circuit theory devoted SCCs is valid only for the two-port configuration, therefore this section is dedicated to revisit the classical concepts of single output SCC and to introduce new ones that enable a broader use of such converters.

\subsection[Introducing H-SCC]{The Hybrid-SCC: Identifying Outputs in Switched Capacitor Converters}

Two types of nodes can be identified in a Switched Capacitor Converter, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dc_pwm_nodes}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed voltage \emph{dc}-nodes, node $a$ % node $a$ in Fig. \ref{fig:dc_pwm_nodes}
  \item Floating voltage \emph{pulsed width modulated}-nodes (\emph{pwm}-nodes),  node $b$ % in Fig. \ref{fig:dc_pwm_nodes}
\end{itemize}

 The fixed voltage \emph{dc}-nodes are the common used nodes to supply a \emph{dc} load. They provide a fixed voltage conversion defined by the topology with a low \emph{ac} ripple, and they always have connected a capacitor between the node and the ground by the so called \emph{dc}-capacitor as shown in the Fig. \ref{fig:dc_pwm_nodes}. Depending on the topology the number of \emph{dc}-nodes can vary between one or more, however topologies that reduce the number of \emph{dc}-capacitors ($C_{dc}$) trend to have a better utilization of the capacitors since \emph{dc}-capacitors do not contribute to transport charge \cite{09Seeman}.\\


 The floating \emph{Pulsed Width Modulated}-nodes (\emph{pwm}-nodes) have been rarely used as outputs until a recently  couple of publications \cite{12Kumar,12Kline} presented the advantages of using them. \emph{pwm}-nodes have been normally considered just internal to the converter with any added value, but actually the conversion possibilities of SCCs can be further exploited by using these nodes as outputs.


A \emph{pwm}-node is located a the terminal of a \emph{flying capacitor} ($C_{fly}$) and provides a floating \emph{Pulsed-Width-Modulate} voltage with an added \emph{dc} offset of a fraction of the input voltage. The magnitudes are related to the SCC topology. The pulsated voltages can be filtered using an inductive-capacitive filter (\emph{LC}) allowing to supply \emph{dc} load with averaged voltage of the node. Actually the \emph{pwm} voltage at the node can be controlled adjusting the duty
cycle of the SCC, enhancing the regulation capabilities of these outputs compared to the fixed value of the \emph{dc}-nodes.
The switched capacitor converters that combine the \emph{pwm}-outputs with inductors will be referred from now on as
\emph{Hybrid}-Switched Capacitor Converters (H-SCC).
