\chapter[Modeling of H-SCC]{Modeling of Hybrid Switched Capacitor Converters}
\label{ch:modeling}
Switch capacitor converters are circuits composed of a large number of switches and capacitors, and require accurate models to properly design them. SCCs have the peculiarity to be lossy by nature due to the non adiabatic energy transfer between capacitors, a phenomenon not present in the inductor based converters. Generally, the modeling of SCCs focuses just on the description of the loss mechanisms associated to conduction and capacitor charge transfer, neglecting other sources of losses such as driving and switching losses. The modeled mechanisms of losses are proportional to the output current, being  normally represented with a resistor in the well-known output resistance model.

This chapter presents an enhancement of the charge flow analysis that extends its use to also cover the H-SCC.   The chapter is divided in two sections, the first section is devoted to the study and model of a H-SCC, where the original charge flow analysis~\cite{95Makowski,Seeman:EECS-2009-78} is reviewed and extended. Firstly, discussing and identifying the limiting factors of the previous published models. Subsequently, the charge flow analysis is reformulated with a new approach that enables the analysis of the H-SCC. The second section is devoted to the study of multiple outputs H-SCCs, introducing a new circuit model, and its related methodology to obtain the circuit model parameters. The chapter closes summarizing the contributions of the new modeling approach.

\section{Summary}
This chapter presented a new methodology to analyse SCC that compared with the previous enables to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute the equivalent output resistance from any of the converter nodes.
  \item Compute the conversion ration form any of the converter nodes.
  \item Model converter with multiple outputs.
  \item Compute the coupling parameters between outputs for 2-phase converters.
  \item Include the effects of the output capacitor in $r_{scc}$.
  \item Include the effects of variations in duty cycle in the SSL region.
  \item Model both SCCs and H-SCCs.
\end{itemize}

In addition, a discussion about the different approximations of the $r_{scc}$ using the two asymptotical limits ($r_{ssl}$ and $r_{fsl}$) was provided. Concluding that the \emph{arbitrary} of the original approximation was not less accurate than the new proposed formulations, as the circuit under study diverges from the reference circuit used in these new formulations. Giving the rational, to consider the original formulation as the most appropriated.
