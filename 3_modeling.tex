\chapter[Modeling of H-SCC]{Modeling of Hybrid Switched Capacitor Converters}
\label{ch:modeling}
Switch capacitor converters are circuits composed of a large number of switches and capacitors, and require accurate models to properly design them. SCCs have the peculiarity to be lossy by nature due to the non adiabatic energy transfer between capacitors, a phenomenon not present in the inductor based converters. Generally, the modeling of SCCs focuses just on the description of the loss mechanisms associated to conduction and capacitor charge transfer, neglecting other sources of losses such as driving and switching losses. The modeled mechanisms of losses are proportional to the output current, being  normally represented with a resistor in the well known output impedance model.

This chapter presents an enhancement of  to the charge flow analysis extending its use to cover the H-SCC case.   The chapter is divided in two sections, the first section is devoted to the study and model of a H-SCC. The original charge flow analysis~\cite{95Makowski,Seeman:EECS-2009-78} is reviewed and extended. Initially, the previous models are discussed and identifying the factor that limits their applicability for the \emph{hybrid} converters . Subsequently, the charge flow analysis is reformulated with a new approach. The second section is devoted to the study of multiple outputs H-SCC, introducing a new modeling circuit and the related methodology to obtain the model parameters. The chapter closes summarizing the contributions of the new modeling approach.

\section{Summary}
This chapter presented a new methodology to analyse SCC that enables to model H-SCC, introduced in the pervious chapter. Compared with the previous methodology, the new one enables to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute the equivalent output resistance from any of the converter nodes.
  \item Compute the conversion ration form any of the converter nodes.
  \item Model converter with multiple outputs.
  \item Compute the coupling parameters between outputs for 2-phase converters.
  \item Include the effects of the output capacitor in $r_{scc}$.
  \item Include the effects of variations in duty cycle in the SSL region.
  \item Model both SCCs and H-SCCs.
\end{itemize}
